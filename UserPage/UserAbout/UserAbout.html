                Ususan is the first village coming from the north by the town of Pateros across the Taguig- Pateros river. Fort Bonifacio is situated in Barangay Ususan but was acquired by the United States government and converted it into <br />
                a military camp named Fort McKinley. <br /> <br />

                Barangay Ususan is one of the original barrios comprising the town of Taguig when it was founded as pueblo under the then renamed Morong and lately Rizal, in memory of our National Hero, Dr. Jose Rizal. At the turn of the century in 1903,
                Pateros and Muntinlupa then became parts of Taguig but were eventually established as independent towns. <br /> <br />

                According to a legend handed down from generation to generation, slopes of highlands, now known as Fort Bonifacio, surrounded a lowland which old folks named Barrio Ususan, meaning “sliding down”. Also the ancestors of Barangay Ususan
                retrieved the image of St. Ignatius of Loyola floating along the river, which later became their Patron Saint. Barangay Ususan became an independent parish, St. Ignatius of Loyola Parish
                on September 12, 1986. <br /><br />

                When Metropolitan Manila was created, Taguig was integrated into it together with 16 other cities and towns. Taguig is now a highly urbanized city.
